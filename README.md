# Simple-Autoclicker
A lightweight Python autoclicker for macOS that lets you:
- Set a click interval
- Record a hotkey to toggle clicking
- Start/stop the click loop using buttons
- View current click status and interval in a simple GUI
- Uses Tkinter GUI

You can install the needed libraries using:

```bash
pip install pyautogui keyboard
```

Didn't know how to get keys from scan_code using keyboard, gave up and just hard coded it into a hashmap.
